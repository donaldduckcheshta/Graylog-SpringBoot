GRAYLOG SERVER SETUP 


Introduction
Graylog is a powerful open-source log management platform. It aggregates and extracts important data from server logs, which are often sent using the Syslog protocol. It also allows you to search and visualize the logs in a web interface.


Prerequisites
One Ubuntu 16.04 server
Elasticsearch 2.x. Certain versions of Graylog only work with certain versions of Elasticearch. For example, Graylog 2.x does not work with Elasticsearch 5.x. Refer to this Greylog-Elasticsearch version comparison table for the exact version. This Document uses Elasticsearch 2.4.4 and Graylog 2.2.
MongoDB.
Oracle JDK 8 installed.


Step 1 — Installing Graylog
In this step, we we'll install the Graylog server..
wget https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-2.2-repository_latest.deb


Next, install the repository configuration from the .deb package file, again replacing 2.2 with the version you downloaded.
sudo dpkg -i graylog-2.2-repository_latest.deb


Now that the repository configuration has been updated, we have to fetch the new list of packages. Execute this command:
sudo apt-get update


Next, install the graylog-server package:
sudo apt-get install graylog-server


Lastly, start Graylog automatically on system boot with this command:
sudo systemctl enable graylog-server.service


Graylog is now successfully installed, but it's not started yet. We have to configure it before it will start.
 
Step 2 — Configuring Graylog

Graylog's configuration file is located at /etc/graylog/server/server.conf by default.

First, we need to set the password_secret value. Graylog uses this value to secure the stored user passwords. We will use a randomly-generated 128-character value.
We will use pwgen to generate the password, so install it if it isn't already installed:

sudo apt install pwgen

Generate the password and place it in the Graylog configuration file. We'll use the sed program to inject the password_secret value into thGraylog configuration file. This way we don't have to copy and paste any values. Execute this command to create the secret and store it in the file:

sudo -E sed -i -e "s/password_secret =.*/password_secret = $(pwgen -s 128 1)/" /etc/graylog/server/server.conf


Next, we need to set the root_password_sha2 value. This is an SHA-256 hash of your desired password. Once again, we'll use the sed command to modify the Graylog configuration file so we don't have to manually generate the SHA-256 hash using shasum and paste it into the configuration file.

Execute this command, but replace password below with your desired default administrator password:
•sudo sed -i -e "s/root_password_sha2 =.*/root_password_sha2 = $(echo -n 'password' | shasum -a 256 | cut -d' ' -f1)/" /etc/graylog/server/server.conf


Now, we need to make a couple more changes to the configuration file. Open the Graylog configuration file with your editor:
sudo nano /etc/graylog/server/server.conf



Find and change the following lines, uncommenting them and replacing graylog_public_ip with the public IP of your server. This can be an IP address or a fully-qualified domain name.

/etc/graylog/server/server.conf

...
rest_listen_uri = http://your_server_ip_or_domain:9000/api/

...
web_listen_uri = http://your_server_ip_or_domain:9000/

...

HERE I HAD USED THE BIND IP 0.0.0.0 IN PLACE OF SERVER IP

AND WE HAVE TO ALSO EDIT AND UNCOMMENT :-
rest_transport_uri = http://server_public_ip:9000/api


Mongo Configuration In Server.conf


MongoDB connection string
mongodb_uri = mongodb://dev_mgo01:123456@localhost:27017/graylog

Here dev_mgo01 is the USER created in Mongodb and 123456 Is the password for that user. To connect Mongodb to graylog we have to first create a user for graylog with specific role such as.

 db.createUser(
... { user : "dev_mgo01" , pwd : "123456!" , roles : [{ role: "userAdmin" , db : "graylog" }]});
Successfully added user: {
	"user" : "dev_mgo01",
	"roles" : [
		{
			"role" : "userAdmin",
			"db" : "graylog"
		}
	]
}





Save the file and exit your editor.

Since we changed the configuration file, we have to restart (or start) the graylog-server service. The restart command will start the server even if it is currently stopped.
sudo systemctl restart graylog-server

Next, check the status of the server.
sudo systemctl status graylog-server




The output should look something like this:
● graylog-server.service - Graylog server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/graylog-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

Step 3 — Creating an Input

Let's add a new input to Graylog to receive logs. Inputs tell Graylog which port to listen on and which protocol to use when receiving logs. We 'll add a Syslog UDP input, which is a commonly used logging protocol.
When you visit http://your_server_ip:9000 in your browser, you'll see a login page. Use admin for your username, and use the password you entered in Step 3 for your password.
Once logged in, you'll see a page titled "Getting Started".

To view the inputs page, click the System dropdown in the navigation bar and select Inputs.
You'll then see a dropdown box that contains the text Select Input. Select Syslog UDP from this dropdown, and then click on the Launch new input button.
A modal with a form should appear. Fill in the following details to create your input:
For Node, select your server. It should be the only item in the list.
For Title, enter a suitable title, such as Linux Server Logs.
For Bind address, use your server's private IP. If you also want to be able to collect logs from external servers (not recommended, as Syslog does not support authentication), you can set it to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).
For Port, enter 8514. Note that we are using port 8514 for this tutorial because ports 0 through 1024 can be only used by the root user. You can use any port number above 1024 should be fine as long as it doesn't conflict with any other services.
Click Save. The local input listing will update and show your new input.


Now that an input has been created, we can send some logs to Graylog.
